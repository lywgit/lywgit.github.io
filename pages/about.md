Welcome! &emsp; :smile:

I am Liang-Yao Wang 王亮堯. This is my personal blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I am keeping some notes here from time to time to help organize things (hopefully).  

I receive my Ph.D degree in astrophysics from National Taiwan University (NTU) recently. Before that, I have a master degree in astrophysics and majored in physics as an undergraduate, also in NTU. After finishing the study, I decided to explore a different path. I am now preparing and persuing the course of machine learning and data science.   

As a person who enjoy learning, reasoning, and understanding stuff, machine learning is naturally interesting as the goal is to learn useful knowledge from data. This is especially true for deep learning, as we are yet to see how far human can go.
