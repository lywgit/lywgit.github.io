## Code Development

I have authored three coding projects to meet the need of my own research. They are *not* made publicly available due to group policy.

1. **synline** (*C++*)<br/>
    Synline is a program written in *C++* that performs raytracing along the line-of-sight direction for molecular emission lines. It takes 2D axisymmetric simulation result from the Magnetohydrodynamic simulation code Zeus-TW (in spherical coordinate) and outputs synthetic image cubes for imaging and analysis.
    * An Array class is written as the basic data structure.
    * MPI parallel computing is leveraged to speed up the computation. 

2. **outflow_visualization** (*MATLAB*)<br/>
    Outflow_visualization projects contain MATLAB functions for visualizing and analyzing outflow simulations from (1) the Zeus-TW program and (2) post-processed synthetic images generated by the synline program.

3. **chemistry-Mate** (*Python*)<br/> 
    Utility codes that help us work with the chemical evolution code by our collaborator Máté Ádámkovics. It includes (1) a parser to parse and convert the reactions network file into a python code kinetic.py for computation, and (2) simple visualizing scripts to examine the output abundances.
