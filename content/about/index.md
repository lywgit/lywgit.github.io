Hi, I am Liang-Yao Wang | 王亮堯

I received my Ph.D. in **[Astrophysics]({{< ref "astrophysics/index.md" >}})** from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2018. Prior to that, I completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and undergraduate degree in Physics, both from NTU. Research is fun!

Near the end of my Ph.D. studies, I started to explore the fields of **machine learning** and **data science**. 

From 2018 to 2024, I have worked at Wistron Corporation as a senior software engineer / technical supervisor, where I made major contribution to a variety of [machine learning projects]({{< ref "wistron" >}}). I also became interested in software development and machine learning system as a whole as my experience broadened. 

In 2025, I have been actively building new skills using platforms like [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/lyw) and LeetCode. I also dived into the basics of reinforcement learning through an interesting [side project]({{< ref "posts/2025-10-10-rl-asteroids-ai-project/index.md" >}}) where I trained game playing agents with Rainbow DQN. 

My goal is to be acquainted with machine learning and grow with AI as it transforms our world.
