Hi, I am Liang-Yao Wang 王亮堯

I received my Ph.D. in Astrophysics from National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2018. Prior to that, I completed a Master's degree in Astrophysics and earned my undergraduate degree in Physics, both also from NTU.

Near the end of my Ph.D. studies, I decided to explore the fields of machine learning and data science. From 2018 to 2024, I worked as a software engineer at Wistron Corporation, where I contributed to a variety of machine learning-related projects. During this time, my interest in software development more broadly also grew.

In 2025, I have been actively building new skills through platforms like LeetCode and Boot.dev.
