I have worked at Wistron corporation from 2018 to 2024 as senior software engineer / technical supervisor.
During this fruitful journey, our team implemented ML/AI solutions for different domain users in our company, creating value from day-to-day work.

### Serial number recognition on key cap & dome AOI images (2019~)
- ðŸ”¸ Yolo-v3 (darknet) + keras classifier
- ðŸ”¸ opencv-python image processing
- âœ¦ Accuracy on par with human inspector
- âœ¦ Traditional OCR package not applicable

### AOI defect image One-AI system (2020~)
#### Yolo-v3 as defect image detector
- ðŸ”¸ Yolo v3 (tensorflow)
- âœ¦ Sensitive to fine feature not captured by image classifiers
- âœ¦ Accuracy limit by ambiguous cases
#### Image data distribution visualization
- ðŸ”¸ opencv-python
- ðŸ”¸ scikit-learn
- ðŸ”¸ matplotlib
- âœ¦ Speed up dataset Inspection
- âœ¦ Add explainability for user

### Accelerated FIR issue response system (2021~) 
#### Issue classification model
- ðŸ”¸ Pytorch: Bert + Fine tuning 
- ðŸ”¸ Multi-tasks learning: (multi-class) symptom prediction + (multi-label) commodity prediction

- âœ¦ Major class classification accuracy > 80%
- âœ¦ Saving > 70% manual rejudge time
#### Dashboard 
- ðŸ”¸ SQL (postgres)
- ðŸ”¸ Power BI
- ðŸ”¸ python (pandas)
- âœ¦ Integrate multiple data sources
- âœ¦ Saving manual analysis efforts
#### Model life cycle management
- ðŸ”¸ pytorch 
- ðŸ”¸ python (Azure python sdk)
- ðŸ”¸ Azure Machine Learning resource
- âœ¦ Scheduled or manual retrain to keep  model up to date 

### Smart guide repair system (2022~)
#### MLOps platform Repair engineer assistant 
- ðŸ”¸ Azure ML resource and AI services
- âœ¦ PoC experiment with 5 junior engineers shows 70% UPPD rise and less second round part order

### Telemetry Alert System (2023~) 
#### SW version -key event analysis functionality
- ðŸ”¸ SQL (clickhouse)
- ðŸ”¸ Power BI
- âœ¦ Provide new, previously unavailable information 
#### Issue prediction based on telemetry event logs
- ðŸ”¸ SQL (clickhouse, postgres)
- ðŸ”¸ python (databricks, azure blobs)
- âœ¦ Leading indicator of actual FIR issue
- âœ¦ Early analysis and containment action
